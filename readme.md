## Current Progress

### Day 1 - Javascript Drum Kit - Complete
What I Learned: Having only used jQuery for event listeners, it was good to see how its done in vanilla Javascript.

it was great to learn that you can put a listener on the end of a transition using 'transitionend'. this is definitely a technique I will use in the future!

### Day 2 - JS and CSS Clock - Complete
What I Learned: As straight forward as a clock can be, I just learned the recipe on how to make a clean simple clock! I'm taking that logic with me!

sidenote: The new css features on devtools are soo neat!
