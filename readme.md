## Current Progress

### Day 1 - Javascript Drum Kit - Complete
What I Learned: Having only used jQuery for event listeners, it was good to see how its done in vanilla Javascript.

it was great to learn that you can put a listener on the end of a transition using 'transitionend'. this is definitely a technique I will use in the future!

### Day 2 - JS and CSS Clock - Complete
What I Learned: As straight forward as a clock can be, I just learned the recipe on how to make a clean simple clock! I'm taking that logic with me!

sidenote: The new css features on devtools are soo neat!

### Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1 - Complete
What I Learned: It was great to go back and drill array methods, especially the reduce method, I struggled fully understanding reduce during school but not it finally clicked!

I also wanted to bring attention to the screenshot below because this is the first time i've pulled information off of a webpage before. felt like a real #hackerman

### Day 5 - Flex Panels - Complete
What I Learned: I was always wondering how to create these kinds of panels!

The code below in particular was enjoyable to learn: Grab the first child element and keep it off of the page, once the "open-active" class is added it then grabs that element and brings it onto the page.

```
.panel > *:first-child { transform: translateY(-100%); }
.panel.open-active > *:first-child { transform: translateY(0); }
```

```
new RegExp(this.value, 'gi')
```

### Day 7 - Array Cardio Day 2 - Complete

### Day 7 - HTML5 Canvas - Complete
What I Learned: Wow, a lot today! Every new concept really expands what I think is possible with just vanilla JS. I've never used canvas before and it was cool to learn how to track X and Y coordinates based off of the event handler.

I'm very interested to see how this translates over to React.
